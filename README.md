### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm NoÃ«lle Midnight (e/er), a neuroqueer data nerd in Seattle, WA.

I'm a contract data associate at [Allovue](https://www.allovue.com/). I'm a self-taught analyst who's working on finding full time employment in the field following a career switch that's pulled me out of insurance and into coding.  I adore working with R and SQL, as they just work with my brain.  I'm currently working my way through some O'Reilly books on utilizing R for Data Science and am already queueing up additional work to help me understand how to best utilize my (admittedly rusty) statistics skills.

To that end, I've enrolled in college starting this spring, which I intend to do alongside full time employment.  My goal is to attend the University of Washington pursuing a bachelor's in computer science, having followed their data science track.  I hope to eventually work in healthcare, working to improve the availability and breadth of transgender healthcare data so that future generations don't have to do the same amount of medical guesswork as I have had to do.

On a personal side of things, I'm a [photographer](https://www.midnightphotoandfineart.com/photos) and I have a [new music newsletter](https://buttondown.email/noellesnewnoise) where I write about the new releases that I find most interesting each week, compiling them into an ~4 hour playlist.  I also [knit](https://www.ravelry.com/people/NoelleMidnight) and enjoy [movies](https://www.letterboxd.com/NoelleMidnight) in my free time.
